Methods 

To scrape news websites and extract keywords related to women's right topic we use python libraries that parse html tree (BeautifulSoup) and natural language processing (NLTK) to get most frequents bigrams. The format of the website has to be manually inspected to define the relevant tag contents. In our case, two tags identifying the column of interest in the primary website page as well as a tag to identify the article itself is secondary pages are manually determined. The articles content is cleaned with regular expressions to keep only the relevant part of the text (e.g. copyright ignored).
