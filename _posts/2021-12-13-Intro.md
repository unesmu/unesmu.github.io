While quotations can be important pieces of
wisdom by themselves, their meaning is enriched by the context of
an attributed speaker.
#in our data we are goint to look at ... and ask a few questions based on the dataset


The investigation of the dataset will look into who, when and how? 
Indeed, our selection of quotes with their additional metadata allows us to explore who relies on such arguments as gender equality but also when does that happen. The natural languague processing on the quotations will enable to answer to the question of how

---------

Our starting dataset is a selection of quotations about feminism and gender equality. The selection was based on a list of keywords created both manually and automatically. This approach aims at reducing the bias of a lonely manual keywords list or a lonely automatic keywords selection. 
For the automatic keywords, we scraped the usnews.com website because they have some topic pages that list all articles on the specified topic. The articles belonging to 5 subjects were selected to form a corpus.

`feminism` `gender`      `gender_bias`      `sexism`        `women's rights`  

</p>


From this corpus a list of the frequent bigrams were retrieved. We decided to not count onegrame because they are too general for our purpose, for example 'women' gives a lot of results but isn't always of interest. Finally we end up with a list of 64 keywords use to retrieve quotation from the Quotebank dataset. 
The final dataset has 87161 entries related to women's rights and gender equality rhetoric.

In order to decipher what we have in our dataset we created categories within our feminist dataset. The selection keywords were used to split our dataset into 10 categories.

# Methods 

To scrape news websites and extract keywords related to women's right topic we use python libraries that parse html tree (BeautifulSoup) and natural language processing (NLTK) to get most frequents bigrams. The format of the website has to be manually inspected to define the relevant tag contents. In our case, two tags identifying the column of interest in the primary website page as well as a tag to identify the article itself is secondary pages are manually determined. The articles content is cleaned with regular expressions to keep only the relevant part of the text (e.g. copyright ignored).
