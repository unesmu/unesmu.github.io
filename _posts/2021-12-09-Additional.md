_The topic analysis carried out in the section [What do people talk about?](https://unesmu.github.io/2021-12-12-RQ3/) results from a clustering work to represent in a synthetic manner all the quotes dealing with Women's Rights from 2015 to 2020.
We are then interested in extracting from all these quotes those which relate to femonationalism and therefore which specifically use the key words **_muslim_**, **_women_**, **_hijab_** and **_oppression_** as appear in the following quote._

Femonationalism is a growing phenomenon that prompted Sara R. Farris to publish a book in 2017 on feminism and women's rights.

We can indeed observe a peak in the number of citations in 2017 referring to the concept of femonationalism, in particular due to the notoriety of his book.

Many quotes during this period have negative connotations. They appear in the middle of 2017, in dark blue on the following histogram:

We have succeeded in isolating, thanks to Vader, the most frequent negated keywords of these quotes. Quotes with negative connotations deal with the terror of women and their oppression. Of all the quotes related to femonationalism during mid-2017, the word **_persecution_** was mentioned 24 times, **_murder_** 21 times, **_innocent_** 21 times and **_slaughter_** 20 times.

We could relate this observation to the Trump affair that took place in December 2017 (see [Women's right and gender equality in quotes, an ADA story](https://unesmu.github.io/2021-12-11-RQ2/)).

However, the most reasonable explanation remains the rise of femonationalism because the terms used to refer to oppression and terror are mingled with the Islamophobic vocabulary frequently used both in the US and elsewhere by extremist and racist political parties. As a matter of fact, these political parties generally seek to arouse fear by using such vocabulary as **_muslim_** that was present more than 500 times in the quotes from the mid-2017.
