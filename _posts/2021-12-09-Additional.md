_The topic analysis carried out in the section [What do people talk about?](https://unesmu.github.io/2021-12-12-RQ3/) provided us a clustered representation of all the quotes from Quotebank's database from 2015 to 2020 dealing with Women's Rights.
We are now interested in explaining the quotes linked to femonationalism topic and thus explicitely making use of the main keywords **_muslim_**, **_women_**, **_hijab_** and **_oppression_** as it is appearing in the following quote:_

> By refusing to conform to the `hijabi stereotype' , these westernised Muslim women have made it impossible for Left-leaning white saviours to covertly milk this stereotype, in our heroic battle against stereotyping.

Femonationalism is a growing phenomenon that motivated Sara R. Farris to publish a book in 2017 on feminism and women's rights.

We can observe a peak in the number of quotes in 2017 referring to the concept of femonationalism, potentially on account of the notoriety of her book that has been widely refered to.

Many quotes during the mid-2017 have negative connotations and are appearing in dark blue on the following histogram:

We have succeeded in isolating, thanks to Vader, the most frequent negative keywords of these quotes. These negative quotes are mentionning women oppression and the terror. Of all the quotes related to femonationalism during mid-2017, the word **_persecution_** was mentioned 24 times, **_murder_** 21 times, **_innocent_** 21 times and **_slaughter_** 20 times.

We could relate this observation to the Trump affair that took place in December 2017 (see [Women's right and gender equality in quotes, an ADA story](https://unesmu.github.io/2021-12-11-RQ2/)).

However, the most reasonable explanation remains the rise of femonationalism because the terms used to refer to oppression and terror are mingled with the Islamophobic vocabulary frequently used both in the US and elsewhere by extremist and racist political parties. As a matter of fact, these political parties generally seek to arouse fear by using such vocabulary as **_muslim_** that was present more than 500 times in the quotes from the mid-2017.
