This section investigates who has been saying this quotes. It uses the political parties and the gender to make some conclusions. 
Multiple subtopic with similar quotes might be investigated. 

Beyond considering the context in which the rights of women are evoked, it is necessary that our study on the rights of the women consider sooner or later from which type of person most often come from the quotes on equality of the sexes. Our motivations
to support us on a sentiment study
especially the gender or political part of the speaker.

By splitting Quotebank's quotes according to the political part of the speaker we do not observe any notable difference in the enthusiasm present in the quotes dealing with women's rights.
apart from the fact that the Democratic parties seem to refer to it more often during the period studied as an argument.

Here we cannot conclude that political parties in the US doesn't seem to hesitate showing their disapproval with the women rights or anything link to that topic can be both sad or happy in either case.

It is also informative to study whether women have a different approach to men and whether they convey a different attitude in their quotes dealing with women's rights.
We have noticed that it is not possible to distinguish the speakers solely on basis of their sex.

However, we must be careful not to rule out the possibility that the very fact that a person has their own citation act as a confounder to conclude that gender isn't linked in any way to the way women's right are perceived.
