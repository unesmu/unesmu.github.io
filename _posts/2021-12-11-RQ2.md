This section will investigate the timeline with sentiment and focus on specific days/months to hghlight that quotes are related to political or social events. For now we can focus on the end of 2017 and show the subcategories found, i.e. that mostly it is sexual harassment quotes that are predominantly found around this time. We could also try to find other events.
