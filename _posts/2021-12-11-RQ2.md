<!--
_This section will investigate the timeline with sentiment and focus on specific 
days/months to hghlight that quotes are related to political or social events._
_For now we can focus on the end of 2017 and show the subcategories found, i.e. that
 mostly it is sexual harassment quotes that are predominantly found around this time._ 
_We could also try to find other events._
  -->

The selected quotes for our study have been attributed dates between 2015 and 2020 approximately. 
Some periods were more active than others, hence one can wonder how did the sentiment of these quotes evolved over these time frames.
_The following analyses are done on a subset of the quotes tha we previously selected using keywords, more precisely, those that had a non empty QID entry._


## How people feel about women's right and gender equality?

</p>

Title:

The medians are pretty symmetric, i.e.-0.60 on the negative side and 0.6405  on the positive side. 
ADD A TEST TO CHECK IF  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MEDIANS IS SIGNIFICATIVE  We can conclude that most opinion are either neutral, either distributed over positive and negative opinions. No shift towards one side or the other can be demonstrated. 


## How has Sentiment Evolved over time ?

_To do : add titles / legends to all plots_
Separating the quotes into three categories, positive negative and neutral using thresholds on sentiment scores releaves 
that around the end of 2017 and early 2018 there is an increase in the amount of negative quotes.
Neutral quotes are also present but generaly less than each of the other categories, 
this could be something that is sensitive the threshold used to select neutral / positive / negative quotes. ( todo: check this)

Aggregating the data ( each square represents a month (31 days) , and and sentiment interval of 0.05, color represents the proportion ) 
shows furthermore that there is an inscrease in the quotes with negative sentiment around the end of 2017

todo : find a way to normalize by time period only

Seems like there were a lot of negative quotes end of 2017
We could maybe use the list provided by wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_the_United_States#October to see if there were quotes about that

## Are peaks in sentiment related to political or social events ?

To further investigate what happened around 2017, we look at the shift of sentiment. The medians are shifted to -0.65 for the negative one and 0.5994 for the postiive side.

to try and find what even this corresponds to,
keywords are used to put the quotes into different categories. 
Surprisingly enough almost all of the quotes go into the "sexual" category.
This suggests there might have been a sexual harassment scandal around this time period.

Here are the 5 most commons words in the quotes selected from the heatmap. This confirm our hypothesis and allows us to look into more details.

These keywords hint towards a sexual harassment scandal. Looking at the 100th most frequent word and additional hint with the "congress" keyword also highlight what might be the topic. The quotes are here to confirm the hyptothesis. 
**Quotes**
======
> I hope and expect that the Ethics Committee will fully investigate this troubling incident, as they should with any credible allegation of sexual harassment

> To use terminology that has become familiar as the systemic reality of sexual harassment and assault has come more and more to light, Mark Schwahn's behaviour over the duration of the filming of *One Tree Hill* was something of an open secret. 

> We stand together today to underscore this important day. As women, mothers, family physicians, and ministers responsible for improving the well-being of Indigenous communities, ending violence towards women is an issue that is close to our hearts. Violence against women and girls is simply not acceptable. Addressing it requires a united front

And a quick internet google serach gives us the full story.

While these might not be entirely representative they seem to be pointing at .... 

## Other events


Here we use the additional dataset ( wikipedia historical US events page) do show what events are mainly talked about -
_todo : make sure this is relevant : show proof that quotes are mostly US related_

Candidate events  are :

* "Tough talk on immigration: Shortly after taking office in January, President Trump sought to make good on his “America First” campaign promise by imposing a series of contentious travel bans on citizens from several Muslim-majority nations."

* "Federal district courts struck down implementation of the bans, though a Supreme Court ruling in December 2017 reversed the lower courts’ decisions, allowing the administration to fully implement the bans."

* "Trump also continued to promote his election campaign idea of a border wall with Mexico that he says will help quell illegal immigration from Mexico and points south."
