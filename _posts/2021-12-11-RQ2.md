_This section will investigate the timeline with sentiment and focus on specific 
days/months to hghlight that quotes are related to political or social events._
_For now we can focus on the end of 2017 and show the subcategories found, i.e. that
 mostly it is sexual harassment quotes that are predominantly found around this time._ 
_We could also try to find other events._


The selected quotes for our study have been attributed dates between 2015 and 2020 approximately. 
Some periods were more active than others, hence one can wonder how did the sentiment of these quotes evolved over these time frames.
_The next analysis are done on quotes that have been selected (.. TODO : add precise details about which quotes we used here after deciding)._

## How has Sentiment Evolved over time ?

_To do : add titles / legends to all plots_
Separating the quotes into three categories, positive negative and neutral using thresholds on sentiment scores releaves 
that around the end of 2017 and early 2018 there is an increase in the amount of negative quotes.

Aggregating the data ( each square represents a month (31 days) , and and sentiment interval of 0.05, color represents the proportion )

todo : find a way to normalize by time period only


## Are peaks in sentiment related to political or social events ?
