_This section will investigate the timeline with sentiment and focus on specific days/months to hghlight that quotes are related to political or social events._
_For now we can focus on the end of 2017 and show the subcategories found, i.e. that mostly it is sexual harassment quotes that are predominantly found around this time._ 
_We could also try to find other events._


the quotes we selected have been attributed dates between 2015 and 2020 approximately. 
Some periods were more active than others, hence one can wonder how did the sentiment of these quotes evolved over these time frames.
The next analysis are done on quotes that have been selected (.. TODO : add precise details about which quotes we used here after deciding) .
