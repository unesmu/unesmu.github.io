<!--
_This section will investigate the timeline with sentiment and focus on specific 
days/months to hghlight that quotes are related to political or social events._
_For now we can focus on the end of 2017 and show the subcategories found, i.e. that
 mostly it is sexual harassment quotes that are predominantly found around this time._ 
_We could also try to find other events._
  -->

From March 2015 to January 2020, 87'161 quotes related to women's rights and gender equality have been uttered. As we will see later some periods were more active than others, hence one can wonder what are the reasons for fluctuations. Is an increase in occurence related to the arrival of a new equality rights question in the politic debate or by a scandal about sex trafficking? One way to start answering this question is to look at the sentiment of these quotes.
Which brings us to our first question :


## How do people feel about women's rights and gender equality overall?
<!--![sentiment polarized with medians](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epfl-ada/ada-2021-project-concatsanddogs/main/img/all_quotes_with_medians.png){: .    mx-auto.d-block :}  -->
In order to quantify the evolution of people sentiment with time, it is interesting to understand how people feel about women's rights and gender equality **overall**. Separating the quotes into three categories --positive, neutral and negative-- allows visualization of sentiment scores distribution over all quotations.

		</i>
	</small>

</p>

The distribution has a few interesting features.

- Overall large number of quotations are neutral 
- The medians are almost symmetric, i.e.-0.60 on the negative side and 0.6405  on the positive side for the ensemble of all quotations
- The proportion of positive to negative quotes is TO ADD 

<!--ADD A TEST TO CHECK IF  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MEDIANS IS SIGNIFICATIVE (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test probably?)-->
We can conclude that most opinions are either neutral or distributed over positive and negative opinions.
No shift towards one side or the other can be demonstrated, rather we have three peaks, one for neutral, one for positive and one for negative sentiments. We can see some secondary peaks around the -0.60, but we will come back to that later

TO DO : change bin size of neutral sentiments to be the same as others


_The following analyses are done on a subset of the women's rights and gender equality quotations dataset. More precisely, we focus here on quotes with a non empty QID entry as there are the only one we can extract the speaker gender and political orientation._
## How has Sentiment Evolved over time ?

</p>
Separating the quotes into three categories, positive negative and neutral using thresholds on sentiment scores reveales
that around the end of 2017 and early 2018 there is an increase in the amount of negative quotes.
Neutral quotes are also present but generaly less than each of the other categories. Since the threshold
used could affect the number of quotes in a given category we visualize all the sentiment score in function of time.
<!--( todo: check this or turn this into an interactive plot where we can change the threshold) -->

</p>
Aggregating the data this way could indicate that there is an increase in the number of quotes with negative sentiment around the end of 2017,
but since the data isn't normalized by time frame, it could be that there just were generally more quotes around end of 2017 than in other years, even if they were indeed mostly negative.

<!-- todo : find a way to normalize by time period only or criticize i -->

<!-- Seems like there were a lot of negative quotes end of 2017
We could maybe use the list provided by wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_in_the_United_States#October to see if there were quotes about that -->

</p>
Around 2017 and 2018 the _proportion_ of negative quotes is higher than other years, while at the same time,
the proportion of positive quotes decreases, and the proportion of neutral quotes seems relatively stable. Since during those two years the confidence intervals for positive and negative sentiments don't cross each other we can confirm what we said above, but only for the thresholds we used to define each category. <!--  as in if we use a threshold of 0.5 maybe all of the proportions will be basically the same -->

## Are peaks in sentiment related to political or social events ?

To further investigate what happened around 2017, we look at the shift of sentiment. The medians are shifted to -0.65 for the negative one and 0.5994 for the postiive side.

Furthermore, keyword lists were used to categorize the quotes into 7 categories. 
Surprisingly enough almost all of the quotes go into the category related to sexual keywords, "sexual".
This suggests there might have been a sexual harassment scandal around this time period.

Here are the 5 most commons words in the quotes selected from the heatmap. <!--This confirms our hypothesis and allows us to look into more details. -->

</p>

These keywords hint towards a sexual harassment scandal. Looking at the 100th most frequent word "congress" appears to be an additional hint that might highlight the topic. Some sample quotes further illustrate this:
<p style="text-align: center;"> <b> Quotes</b>  </p> 
___
> I hope and expect that the Ethics Committee will fully investigate this troubling incident, as they should with any credible allegation of sexual harassment

> To use terminology that has become familiar as the systemic reality of sexual harassment and assault has come more and more to light, Mark Schwahn's behaviour over the duration of the filming of *One Tree Hill* was something of an open secret. 

> We stand together today to underscore this important day. As women, mothers, family physicians, and ministers responsible for improving the well-being of Indigenous communities, ending violence towards women is an issue that is close to our hearts. Violence against women and girls is simply not acceptable. Addressing it requires a united front

While these might not be entirely representative they seem to be pointing at the [Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations) that happened around the same period. Of course, since the keywords where all selected by hand, all of the quotes above might not be only about the Donald sexual allegations so we try to explore other possible events.

## Other events

Since some other events could have let to the increase in negative sentiment above we show other possible events that happened between 2015 and 2020 :

<!-- Here we use the additional dataset ( wikipedia historical US events page) do show what events are mainly talked about - 
_todo : make sure this is relevant : show proof that quotes are mostly US related_-->
![annotated events](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epfl-ada/ada-2021-project-concatsanddogs/main/img/events_time.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Candidate events from [history.com](https://www.history.com/topics/21st-century/2017-events#section_1) are :

* "Tough talk on immigration: Shortly after taking office in January, President Trump sought to make good on his “America First” campaign promise by imposing a series of contentious travel bans on citizens from several Muslim-majority nations."

* "Federal district courts struck down implementation of the bans, though a Supreme Court ruling in December 2017 reversed the lower courts’ decisions, allowing the administration to fully implement the bans."

* "Trump also continued to promote his election campaign idea of a border wall with Mexico that he says will help quell illegal immigration from Mexico and points south."


## Discussion about our methods 

### Categorizing quotes
Since the keywords lists were crafted by us, the categories will contain some of our personal biases. <!-- comments on the number of quotes in every list ? are they balanced ? -->

### Sentiment analysis

Mainly, Vader was used, but it's a tool that can't precisely capture the sentiment of a quotes, for instance it won't be able to recognize the
