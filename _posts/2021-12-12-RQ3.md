<!-- This section will cover the unsupervised clustering, with the different methods we use the optimal parameters. The final cluster presentation and the categories finaly chosen, with a few examples for each topic. -->

_In the following part, the words 'cluster' and 'topic' are used interchangeably as one cluster is represented by one topic here_

After selecting quotes using manual keywords we tried **unsupervised** clustering methods. These methods are promising since they would mean it's an algorithm that finds the topics and groups up your quotes, therefore potentially removing human bias from the selection of the topics. 

The tool that has been used is BERTopic. Stop-words are removed from the quotes because they represent a large number of the words and might _take over_ more important information in the quotes. First, the documents ('quotations') in our case are embedding using sentence-BERT, UMAP is then used to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings. Next, HDBSCAN clusters the quotations into topics using the reduced representation. Finally a modified version of TF-IDF is used on each cluster, combined with MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) to choose which words in the cluster represent the cluster, technically the topic, the best.

The main drawback of this method is the stochastic nature of UMAP dimensionality reduction. This means that slightly different clusters were offered at each run, but most of the clusters remained the same. We rand our analysis and saved the model, topics, clusters and keywords to disk to continue our analyses. 

Initially, the model proposed approximately 300 topics. Since this would be very hard to work with, these were reduced to 35. A high enough number is taken such that clusters that were far enough from each other wouldn't be forcibly regrouped. The resulting topics are observed in the bottom two figures :

TO DO : fix the figures, or use the HTML version of this file

TEMPORARY FIX : screeshot of the interactive plot

An important thing to mention is that there is one very large cluster ( ~30000 quotes, knowing that we have ~55000 quotes for this analysis) containing outliers mainly represented by the keywords `women``sexual``harassment``rights`. We accept the behavior of our tool and focus on the remaining quotes that are in clusters. <!-- maybe take a look at the quotes in the outlier cluster and see what can be mentioned about them -->

Taking a more focused look in the topics :

TO DO : add histplot, with topic counts, and under them the list of keywords ( something like Amina did in Fig 1 of the into )

Multiple interesting topics appear, for example the 16th topics seems to be about the mee too movement, the 18th topic seems to be about a sexual harassments scandal involving Bill Oreilly [ link ](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment.html) le 20th topic seems to represent a topic containing matters about indigenous people and kidnappings. 

Example quotes from the 19th category : 

>Our ancestors, the matriarchs, were the speakers, the keepers of ceremony, and our oral history. As a young person, an activist talking about women's rights or about murdered and missing indigenous women, hip-hop has been the best venue to connect with not only my peers and young people, but also the greater public that may have barriers to listening to the stories of First Nations' indigenous people

>our indigenous population is not a haven of gender equality

We can see that the quotes still seem relevant to the initial keyword selection as the `gender equality` keyword pops up in one the quotes.

We take some of the most discussed topics and describe what we observe in them :  (TO DO : not sure if we should do this ) 

TO DO :  maybe even take the subset containing the outliers and try clustering them

## Sexual harassment 
topic -1 (outliers) and other topics, appears often 


## Child care
see topic 0


## Equal pay
see topic 1


## 

Since additional information has been collected on the speakers, we will use it in combination with this clustering method to see how some topics evolved over time.
TO DO : REMOVE THE ABOVE IF WE DON'T END UP DOING THIS
